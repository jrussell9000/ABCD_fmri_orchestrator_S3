  <scope_note>
    This report records a follow-up documentation edit applied at orchestrator level, after the
    primary /document pass at 17:12:36Z had completed. The follow-up was triggered by a
    user-requested exhaustive LLM-attribution scrub scan motivated by a prior incident on the
    upstream fmri_first_level_proc repository, where leaked attribution language caused GitHub
    to auto-list "Claude" as a contributor and required GitHub support intervention to remove.
    The scrub identified one borderline framing item in AID_LOG.md, surfaced it to the user as
    a scope decision, and applied the user-approved rephrasing under a narrow, session-bound
    filesystem grant.

  <files_updated>
    <file path="AID_LOG.md" changes="Section 3 model-tier table column header changed from 'Role' to 'Use Case'. Divider row widened from |------| to |----------| to match the new header width. Row values (Claude Opus 4 | Analytical and review | ...; Claude Sonnet 4 | Implementation | ...) and the surrounding paragraphs are unchanged. Rationale: the 'Role' header paired with role-style values could be read as assigning Claude personhood/agency framing, even though the AID Framework template documents the Role column. Rephrasing to 'Use Case' preserves the framework's tool-disclosure intent while removing the agency framing that, in the upstream repo's incident, may have contributed to GitHub's auto-attribution behavior. The change is the minimum edit that addresses the framing concern without altering disclosure substance.">

      17 grep passes covering: (1) commit-trailer attribution patterns,
      LLM-vendor-domain email-handle patterns, mention-handle patterns,
      robot-emoji markers, and generation-boilerplate phrases; (2) authorship-implying language about Claude/
      LLM/AI in both forward and reverse direction (verb-by-Claude and Claude-verbed-by); (3)

      role-noun and authorship-stem variants across all files; (5) every line containing "claude" or
      "anthropic" case-insensitive; (6) commit messages and full author/committer identity
      enumeration; (7) GitHub metadata files (.github/, FUNDING, CITATION, CODEOWNERS,

      agency framing (I/me/my/we) referring to Claude.

    <hard_trigger_hits>
      Zero. No commit-trailer attribution patterns, no LLM-vendor-domain email
      handles in any commit field or any tracked file, no LLM-tool mention handles,
      no robot-emoji markers, no generation-boilerplate phrases, no commits authored by a
      non-human identity. Only commit identities present: "<author> &lt;<author-email>&gt;"
      and "<author> &lt;<author-email>&gt; / GitHub &lt;<github-noreply-domain>&gt;".
    </hard_trigger_hits>
    <soft_pattern_hits_pre_edit>
      13 lines across 4 files contained "claude" or "anthropic" before the edit. All fell into
      framework-compliant categories: filename references (.aid/project_claude.md, ~/.claude/,
      gitignored CLAUDE.md), AID Framework tool disclosure (Claude Code (Anthropic) at
      AID_LOG.md:31), and model tier disclosure (Claude Opus 4 / Claude Sonnet 4 at AID_LOG.md
      L35-36, L104). All occurrences of "collaborator" and "contributor" in .aid/reports/clean_*
      and cr_* refer to human external readers/reviewers, not to Claude.
    </soft_pattern_hits_pre_edit>
    <borderline_item_surfaced>
      AID_LOG.md L33-37, the model tier table column header "Role" combined with values
      "Analytical and review" / "Implementation". Surfaced to the user with three options:
      keep as-is (framework-compliant), rephrase the header (recommended), or restructure
      the table entirely. User selected option (b), rephrase. Header changed to "Use Case".
    </borderline_item_surfaced>
    <post_edit_status>
      Tracked tree is now clean of role/agency framing for Claude. Sections 4 and 5 of
      AID_LOG.md continue to assert human decision authority and oversight throughout the
      development process, providing defense-in-depth disclosure framing. The repo should
      be safe from the GitHub auto-attribution failure mode that affected the upstream
      fmri_first_level_proc publish cycle.

    <description>
      The orchestrator-level Edit on AID_LOG.md was blocked by enforce-filesystem-scope.sh
      (Gate 2b/2c) because no orchestrator-scope grant permitted overwrite. Per the
      no-self-grants rule in feedback_collaboration_discipline.md, the block was surfaced
      to the user verbatim with the proposed narrow-grant invocation. User approved a
      session-bound grant for path=AID_LOG.md, operations=overwrite, tools=Edit, with an
      explicit instruction to revoke once the work was done. Grant was issued, the single-line
      header edit was applied, the edit was verified by re-reading the file, and the grant
      was revoked. Grant did not persist beyond the immediate edit.

      AID_LOG.md post-edit: framework-compliant tool-disclosure language at L31, L35, L36, L88,
      L104 only (the previously enumerated "Claude Code (Anthropic)" tool disclosure and
      filename references). Zero new agency-framing patterns introduced by the edit. This
      report: contains an intentional reference to the upstream fmri_first_level_proc incident
      and to the user-approved scope call as part of the AID disclosure rationale; no PII
      (no filesystem usernames, emails, IPs, UUIDs, conda paths). The "{path to AID_LOG.md}"
      placeholder in the grant_lifecycle commands is intentional sanitization to avoid
      embedding the absolute working-directory path in the published report.

  <summary>
    Follow-up documentation pass applied a single one-line column-header rephrasing in
    AID_LOG.md (Section 3 model tier table: "Role" to "Use Case"), in response to a
    user-approved scope call from an exhaustive LLM-attribution scrub scan. The scrub found
    zero hard-trigger patterns across the entire tracked tree and full commit history; the
    one borderline item (the role/agency-suggesting column header) is now resolved. The
    edit was applied under a narrow, session-bound filesystem grant that was revoked
    immediately after the work completed. README.md, INPUT_SPECIFICATION.md, and
    .aid/project_claude.md were verified in-scope and required no changes. Tracked tree
    is now clean of role/agency framing for Claude, providing defense-in-depth against the
    GitHub auto-attribution failure mode that affected the upstream fmri_first_level_proc
    publish cycle.
