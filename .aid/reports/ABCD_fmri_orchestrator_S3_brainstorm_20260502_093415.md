    Identify all orchestrator changes required for compatibility with
    fmri-first-level-proc v2.4.0 to v2.5.0. Two upstream changes between
    e2bca93 (v2.4.0, 2026-04-03) and cb2b8f8 (v2.5.0, 2026-05-01):
    (U1) DOF pre-flight regressor-count fix carrying over from this
    orchestrator's prior upstream issue transfer; and (U2) the addition of
    an opt-in sequenced denoising path for rest_conn (Ciric-inspired,
    NTRP-interpolation + decoupled BOLD/nuisance bandpass).

    <topic id="T1" title="Upstream change inventory (v2.4.0 to v2.5.0)">
      <summary>
        Two upstream commits separate the tags. (U1) The DOF pre-flight
        regressor-count fix corrects an over-conservative count that
        previously assumed polort 2 after v2.3.1 had switched to polort -1.
        (U2) v2.5.0 adds an opt-in sequenced denoising path for rest_conn:
        a new boolean config field use_sequenced_bandpass (default false),
        a new CLI flag --use_sequenced_bandpass, two new utility functions
        (censor_interpolate_1d_afni, bandpass_filter_1d_afni), and a refactor
        of gen_residual_ts that dispatches to either
        _generate_run_residual_simultaneous (current behavior) or
        _generate_run_residual_sequenced (six-step Ciric-inspired pipeline).
        The sequenced path produces a per-run intermediate directory
        _sequenced_intermediates/{run_label}/ inside the rest_conn output
        directory, retained or deleted per the existing keep_run_res_dtseries
        flag. Final residual location and naming are unchanged regardless of
        backend.
      </summary>
      <decision status="decided">
        Inventory accepted as-is. No upstream behavior is unexpected or
        mid-flight. The orchestrator must align config templates and
        documentation with the new optional field; no orchestrator code
        changes are required for the field to function.

        Implement all of S1 through S7 (no items deferred). Specifics:

        S1. Add use_sequenced_bandpass: false to the rest_conn block in both
        proc_config_final.yaml and example_proc_config.yaml, with a comment
        documenting that true enables the Ciric-inspired path.

        S2. Update INPUT_SPECIFICATION.md L85 verbatim-passed field list to
        include use_sequenced_bandpass; add a brief note about the optional
        sequenced rest_conn backend and its retention coupling to
        keep_run_res_dtseries.

        S3. Update README.md upstream version requirement from "&gt;= 2.4.0"
        to "&gt;= 2.5.0".

        S4. Append a v2.5.0 alignment entry to AID_LOG.md following the
        AID-framework template, framing the LLM strictly as a tool.

        S5. Update test fixtures (tests/conftest.py L143 and L454,
        tests/golden_config_baseline.yaml L45,
        tests/golden_config_refactored.yaml L80,

        use_sequenced_bandpass: false (or the Python-dict equivalent) in
        every rest_conn schema fixture. Add one new passthrough unit test
        asserting build_first_level_config preserves use_sequenced_bandpass
        in the deep-copied config without modification.

        S6. Pre-existing v2.4.0 leftover: replace the stale
        "python run_first_level.py --config example_config.yaml" usage
        comments at proc_config_final.yaml L6-L9 with the current
        "run-first-level --config ..." entry-point form (the same
        replacement was applied to example_proc_config.yaml during the
        v2.4.0 alignment).

        S7. Pre-flight: verify fmri-first-level-proc v2.5.0 is installed
        (editable) in the ABCD_fmri_orchestrator_S3 conda environment before
        any test execution. Update Config State in MEMORY.md to reflect

Hard halt on any match; no auto-remediation." />

  <next_steps>
    Recommended downstream sequence: (1) /implement plan to translate the
    P0 and P1 action items into a concrete tech spec; (2) /implement build
    to apply the changes; (3) /test run_suite for T-A; (4) /run-local for
    T-B and T-C; (5) /document for the AID_LOG entry and any incidental
    documentation polish surfaced during implementation; (6) /publish with
    the T7 pre-publish scrub enforced as the irreversible gate. Skip T-D
    (full N=30 re-run) entirely.
