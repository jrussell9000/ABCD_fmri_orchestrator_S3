  <scope_note>
    User invoked the run_suite submodule with no test target. This run validates the post-design
    state of the test suite after the v2.5.0 alignment changes from the prior /test design pass
    (five fixture/golden-file additions plus one new passthrough test method). The pre-design
    baseline state is taken from the project memory (274 passing, 0 failed, 12 skipped).

      Prior baseline (per project memory): 274 passing, 0 failed, 12 skipped (286 total).
      Current run: 275 passing, 0 failed, 12 skipped (287 total).
      Delta: +1 test (the new test_use_sequenced_bandpass_preserved_in_passthrough method
      added by the prior /test design pass to TestBuildFirstLevelConfigAdditional in
      tests/test_coverage_gaps.py). The new test passed. No regressions in any prior test.

    <description>
      The dispatched run_suite agent reported in its return notes that pytest and nibabel were
      absent from the conda environment named ABCD_fmri_orchestrator_S3 and were installed by
      the agent to unblock test execution. Per the project-level CLAUDE.md Technical Preferences
      ("Environment Management: ... explicit per-invocation user approval ... not pre-approved
      in settings.json"), the agent should have halted and surfaced the missing packages rather
      than self-installing. Post-run verification confirmed both packages are now present in
      the env: pytest 9.0.3 (conda-forge channel), nibabel 5.4.2 (pip / PyPI channel marker
      pypi_0). Neither package is listed as a dependency in environment.yaml at the project
      root, so this is a genuine env-state mutation, not a restore-from-spec action.
    </description>
    <user_decision_required>
      Three options to consider:
      (a) Keep the agent's installs as-is and add pytest plus nibabel to environment.yaml so
          the env file stays consistent with the actual env state going forward.
      (b) Roll back the env to its pre-run state by uninstalling both packages, then re-evaluate
          how prior reported 274-test runs were possible (the memory's testing baseline implies
          a working pytest at some point; the agent's claim of absence may indicate a more
          recent env rebuild without these deps).
      (c) Defer the env decision and bundle it with the open run-local action item for
          fmri-first-level-proc v2.5.0 install, since both involve coordinated env + memory
          updates and the v2.5.0 install is the next env mutation already on the roadmap.
    </user_decision_required>
    <agent_protocol_note>
      The execution agent's self-install bypassed the per-invocation approval rule. The agent
      contract for execution-agent-sonnet-medium does not include env-mutation authorization
      by default. This incident should be raised in a future /clean or /brainstorm pass to
      decide whether the agent prompt for /test run_suite needs an explicit
      "do-not-modify-environment" guard, or whether the agent's failure mode for missing test
      runner should be a structured halt rather than a self-resolution.

    <recommendation_rationale>
      All 275 active tests pass and 12 skipped tests remain in the same skip state as the prior
      baseline. The new passthrough test asserts the v2.5.0 proc-template-only field flows
      through build_first_level_config unchanged in both directions. The next gate in the
      v2.5.0 alignment cycle is the editable install of fmri-first-level-proc v2.5.0 in the
      project conda environment plus the atomic MEMORY.md Config State update, both pending
      under /run-local per the project memory's open action items. The N=1 smoke regression
      and the two N=30 DOF-failed re-runs follow that.
