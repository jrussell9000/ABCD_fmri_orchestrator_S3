      1. example_orchestrator_config.yaml calc_n_motion_derivs comment: correctly states
         rotations passed through in original units (degrees) per fmri_first_level_proc
         &gt;= 2.4.0 contract — confirmed accurate against code.
      2. orchestrator_utils.py extract_motion_regressors docstring: correctly states
         rotation_unit_ambiguous return value semantics and no conversion — confirmed
         accurate against source logic at lines 1154-1214.
      3. AID_LOG.md: no PII, all sections structurally sound, Section 6 references
         .aid/reports/ and .aid/project_claude.md — both now exist.

    <sections_modified>None — AID_LOG.md was created correctly by the prior run and required

  <summary>This re-run completed the mandatory AID infrastructure tasks that the prior document
  run failed to execute: (1) created .aid/ and .aid/reports/ directories, (2) created
  .aid/project_claude.md as a PII-sanitized copy of the project CLAUDE.md (local paths and
  username replaced), and (3) executed the full PII Screening Gate across all files created
  or modified by both runs — all files passed clean. A spot-check confirmed the prior run's
  three factual corrections (rotation unit handling, NaN imputation to 999.0, force_recompute
  field) are accurately reflected in the codebase. No documentation content was changed in
  this re-run; no functional code was modified in either run.</summary>
