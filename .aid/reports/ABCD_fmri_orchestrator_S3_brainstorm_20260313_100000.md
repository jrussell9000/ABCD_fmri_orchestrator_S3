    <topic id="T1" title="F3: Broad exception catch and minimum-run policy">
      <summary>
        Per-run preprocessing failures are caught by a broad `except Exception`
        at orchestrate_first_level.py:470 and silently downgraded to warnings.
        The run is skipped and processing continues with surviving runs. The CR
        raised concern about (1) lack of structured run-loss warnings with
        power implications, (2) run survival counts in QC, and (3) whether a
        configurable minimum-run policy should gate analysis execution.

        Sub-question (2) is already addressed by the QC enrichment decision
        from the prior brainstorm session (consolidated QC JSON includes
        runs_attempted, runs_succeeded, per_run_status).

    <topic id="T2" title="F4: Rotation unit validation in extract_motion_regressors()">
      <summary>
        orchestrator_utils.py:1120 unconditionally applies np.deg2rad() to
        rotation columns from motion.tsv. No programmatic validation that
        rotations are in degrees. If the upstream mmps_mproc pipeline changed
        output convention to radians, all rotational motion regressors and FD
        contributions would be silently corrupted by a factor of pi/180.

        Discussion focused on finding a definitive diagnostic rather than a
        heuristic plausibility threshold. Physical constraints of MRI head
        coils provide hard boundaries that unambiguously distinguish degree
        and radian conventions.

          <description>
            Exploit the physical impossibility of large rotations inside an
            MRI head coil. The head coil restricts rotation to approximately
            +/- 15-20 degrees maximum.

            Tier 1 — Definitive pass:
              if max(abs(rot_columns)) > 1.0: data MUST be in degrees.
              Rationale: 1.0 radian = 57.3 degrees, physically impossible
              inside a head coil. 1.0 degree is trivially common in any
              real fMRI scan.

            Tier 2 — Ambiguous, hard error:
              if max(abs(rot_columns)) &lt;= 1.0: raise OrchestratorError.
              Rationale: across hundreds of TRs, never exceeding 1 degree
              of rotation in any axis is extraordinarily unlikely for real
              data. If values are this small, they are likely already in
              radians (max 0.35 rad = 20 degrees is plausible). The check
              cannot definitively determine the unit, so it halts and
              requires manual inspection rather than guessing.

            The 1.0 threshold has zero ambiguity in the definitive-pass case:
            no subject can rotate 57.3 degrees in a head coil, yet virtually
            every scan will show > 1.0 degree of rotation somewhere.
          </description>
          <pros>
            Definitive rather than heuristic; uses physical impossibility,
            not statistical plausibility; zero false positives in normal
            operation; hard error on ambiguity prevents silent corruption
          </pros>
          <cons>
            Hard error in the ambiguous case halts processing; requires
            manual inspection for edge cases (though such cases are
            vanishingly unlikely with real data)
          </cons>
          <statistical_considerations>
            The probability of max(abs(rotation)) &lt;= 1.0 degrees across
            an entire fMRI scan (200-400+ TRs) is negligible for real data.
            Even highly compliant adult subjects exhibit rotational
            displacements exceeding 1 degree at some point during a scan.
            For the ABCD pediatric/adolescent sample, this probability is
            effectively zero.

    <topic id="T3" title="F5: HRF model choice documentation (dmBLOCK vs. GAM)">
      <summary>
        proc_config_final.yaml specifies dmBLOCK for n-back activation
        (3dDeconvolve) and GAM for n-back connectivity (3dLSS beta series).
        Different HRF models for the same task events produce different
        design matrices, making activation and connectivity results not
        directly comparable. The CR flagged this as a potential
        interpretive inconsistency requiring justification.

        Discussion confirmed this is standard practice, not a deficiency:
        dmBLOCK is the established model for activation analyses with
        variable-duration events (accommodates block duration), while GAM
        (canonical gamma HRF) is the standard basis for least-squares-
        separate beta series estimation (Rissman et al. 2004, Mumford
        et al. 2012). Duration modulation in beta series estimation is
        non-standard and would introduce degrees of freedom the LSS
        estimator is not designed to handle. The two analyses answer
        fundamentally different questions (mean activation vs. trial-by-
        trial covariance), so different HRF models are methodologically
        coherent.

    <!-- F6: REST_CONN DOF CONSTRAINT -->
    <!-- ================================================================== -->

    <topic id="T4" title="F6: rest_conn DOF constraint at TR=0.8s (polort + bandpass)">
      <summary>
        3dTproject bandpass [0.01, 0.1] at TR=0.8s generates ~324 stopband
        regressors for ~377 TRs via regression-based filtering. Combined
        with polort 2 (3 regressors) and 15 nuisance orts, total fixed
        regressor count (~342) leaves only ~35 DOF. Any run with >10%
        censoring exceeds DOF and fails.

        Detailed mathematical analysis of the bandpass implementation:
        3dTproject constructs sin/cos basis functions spanning the stopband.
        The stopband fraction is fixed at 1 - 2*(high-low)*TR = 0.856,
        meaning ~85.6% of TRs become stopband regressors regardless of
        total scan length. This ratio is invariant to concatenation.

        Polort redundancy: when bandpass is active, stopband regressors
        already capture frequencies below 0.01 Hz, making polynomial
        detrending (polort) redundant. The DC component (0 Hz) is not
        explicitly modeled by stopband sin/cos regressors, but downstream
        connectivity analysis (3dNetCorr Pearson correlation) is mean-
        invariant, making polort -1 (no polynomials) safe.

        Concatenation analysis: the user asked whether concatenating rest
        runs before 3dTproject would alleviate the DOF issue. Mathematical
        analysis showed:
        - Stopband fraction is constant (85.6%) regardless of N_TRs
        - Censoring tolerance as a percentage is ~10% whether per-run or
          concatenated
        - Concatenation introduces a "bad apple" problem: high-censoring
          runs drag down DOF for the entire concatenated dataset
        - Example: ses-00A with runs at 5%, 5%, 31%, 56% censoring —
          per-run: 2 survive; concatenated: 24% overall censoring causes
          total failure, losing the 2 good runs
        - The per-run approach insulates good runs from bad runs and is
          strictly more robust when censoring is heterogeneous across runs

        Changing polort from 2 to -1 saves exactly 3 regressors (342 to
        339), shifting the failure threshold from ~10.0% to ~10.8%
        censoring. This is negligible but methodologically correct
        (removes redundancy).

    <topic id="T5" title="F7: N-back cue relabeling assumption and task timing">
      <summary>
        fix_nback_cue_labels() relabels generic "cue" trial types based on
        the n-back level of the subsequent trial block. The CR raised concern
        that this fundamentally alters the design matrix and requires
        justification.

        Detailed task structure review confirmed the relabeling is correct:

        0-back blocks:
        - First stimulus ("cue") = participant passively views an image from
          the stimulus category (e.g., a positive face). This is the target
          to remember for subsequent match/no-match decisions.
        - Subsequent trials = participant views other images and decides
          match/no-match against the cued target.
        - Relabeling: cue to bare condition name (e.g., "posface"). This
          creates a SEPARATE regressor from recall trials ("0_back_posface"),
          appropriately modeling the distinct cognitive demands: encoding
          (cue) vs. comparison + decision (recall).

        2-back blocks:
        - First stimulus ("cue") = generic instruction screen reading
          "2-BACK" with no stimulus-category content.
        - Subsequent trials = participant views images and decides if current
          matches the stimulus seen two trials ago.
        - Relabeling: cue to "instruction". Pooled across all 2-back
          conditions because the instruction is identical regardless of
          upcoming stimulus category.

        The relabeling preserves category-specific information for 0-back
        cues (which contain real stimuli) while correctly treating 2-back
        cues as generic instructions (which contain no stimulus content).
        The separation of cue and recall events into distinct regressors
        is methodologically appropriate given their qualitatively different
        cognitive demands.

        orchestrate_first_level.py uses concat_mask = per_run_masks[0]
        (first run's brain mask) for smoothing concatenated data. If per-run
        masks differ (e.g., due to susceptibility-induced signal dropout
        varying across runs), the first run's mask may not be representative.

        Although fMRIPrep computes masks in template space (making per-run
        masks near-identical in practice), the intersection operation is
        trivially cheap and strictly more conservative.

    <!-- F10: NaN MOTION IMPUTATION -->
    <!-- ================================================================== -->

    <topic id="T8" title="F10: NaN motion parameter handling (unknown = censor)">
      <summary>
        orchestrator_utils.py:1144 replaces NaN motion values with 0.0 via
        np.nan_to_num(). NaN in motion parameters indicates a tracking
        failure — the true motion is unknown, not zero. Imputing zero makes
        these TRs appear as the stillest frames, virtually guaranteeing
        they survive censoring when they are the least trustworthy.

        Discussion established the principle: missingness is ambiguous and
        the conservative approach is to not trust uncertain TRs. This is
        consistent with the pipeline philosophy that all quality screening
        happens post-hoc — but within-run censoring decisions must be
        conservative at the individual level.

        A hard error threshold on NaN prevalence (e.g., >5%) was rejected.
        Subject exclusion for data quality issues (including extensive
        motion tracking failures) is handled post-hoc at group level, not
        during first-level processing. The pipeline should process whatever
        data is available and let QC metrics inform exclusion.

            1. Count NaN occurrences and log their TR indices and column
               names at WARNING level.
            2. Replace NaN values with a large value (e.g., 999.0) that
               guarantees the TR will exceed any reasonable FD threshold
               and be censored by upstream's 1d_tool.py.
            3. No hard error threshold — let the data flow through
               regardless of NaN prevalence. If a run has 100% NaN motion,
               every TR will be censored, the run will fail DOF checks,
               and it will be recorded in QC. Subject exclusion happens
               post-hoc.

            This implements an explicit "unknown = censor" policy: if the
            motion tracking system could not estimate head position for a
            TR, that TR is treated as high-motion and censored.

            Large imputed values could affect motion derivative computation
            for adjacent TRs (derivative of 999.0 is large), but those
            adjacent TRs would also likely be censored as a consequence,
            which is arguably appropriate for TRs neighboring a tracking
            failure

          <statistical_considerations>
            The imputed value must exceed the maximum plausible FD threshold
            used in any analysis config. A value of 999.0 mm for
            translations (and 999.0 radians for rotations) guarantees
            censoring under any threshold. The derivative spillover to
            adjacent TRs is a conservative side effect — tracking failures
            often co-occur with rapid motion, so censoring neighbors is
            defensible.

        orchestrate_first_level.py:325 uses is_rest = task_label.lower()

        Discussion rejected the CR's recommendation of an is_rest config
        field as unnecessary complexity for an ABCD-specific orchestrator.
        Instead, the user proposed a strict whitelist: if task_label is

    complete. The recommended next step is /implement mode:

    1. Generate a unified technical specification (tech spec) from the two
       brainstorm reports (Session 13: F1-F2 + QC enrichment; Session 14:
       F3-F19) consolidating all implementation action items.

    2. Implementation priority order:
       - P0 first: F1 (qualified session reporting), F2 (QC architecture
         overhaul + consolidated QC JSON) — these are critical and
         interdependent
       - P1 second: F4 (rotation check), F8 (force_recompute), F10
         (NaN handling), F11 (task whitelist), F12 (S3 gap probing),
         F3 (run-loss warning)
       - P2 last: F9 (mask intersection)

    3. After implementation: /test to update the test suite (161 existing
       tests + new tests for all changes), then /run-local to retest
       sub-00CY2MDM with the updated pipeline.

    4. After successful retest: /document for F5 and F7 documentation
       items, then /publish.
